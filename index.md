# 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design

A good interface should be designed to avoid errors as much as possible. However, if something goes wrong, your system should make it easy for users to understand and resolve 
the problem. Simple ways to deal with errors include displaying clear error notifications and descriptive hints to resolve the problem.
To achieve this there are 8 rules that must be applied in every interface

Those rules are:

### 1. Strive for consistency.
### 2. Seek universal usability.
### 3. Offer informative feedback.
### 4. Design dialogs to yield closure.
### 5. Prevent errors.
### 6. Permit easy reversal of actions.
### 7. Keep users in control.
### 8. Reduce short-term memory load.
